# Behavioural Market Analytics: Quantitative Assessment of M&amp;A-Induced Price Dynamics in High-Capitalization Tech Equities
## Description: <br>
Conducted a data-driven analysis to evaluate how major tech stocks (namely - Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Cisco System, Facebook (Meta), Google, HP, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Nokia, Oracle, Salesforce) historically responded to M&A (mergers and acquisitions) announcements (Over 500+ companies). 

Using Python, I sourced, cleaned, and analyzed historical stock price data and M&A event timelines. The project included statistical analysis of pre- and post-announcement price movements, volatility patterns, and comparative trends across companies. Insights were visualized using Tableau dashboards, highlighting patterns in investor sentiment, market reaction timelines, and impact by deal size or sector. 

This analysis aimed to identify recurring behaviors in stock movement around M&A events to support financial forecasting and strategic decision-making.
